Universal Desktop Entry File Editor (concept)

This is a concept of a XDG Desktop Entry editor that is based on a simple principle: exposing the underlying spec and capabilities it provides in a straightforward way.

It would consist of two components:
1. The entry editor itself, which would provide means to edit/add/remove fields to a desktop entry.
2. XDG structure editor, which would expose presense of and relations between entries scattered throughout various XDG hierarchies: Applications, Autostart, Directories.
